# FlexRL

This package implements the Stochastic EM approach to Record Linkage described in '[https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06835](A flexible model for Record Linkage)' (submitted) and developed by _Kayan√© Robach_ and _Michel Hof_.

The main article and its supplementary material are available on [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06835](arxiv).

On this repository you can find the code to run the simulations and to run the real data applications on the NLTCS data and SHIW data.
